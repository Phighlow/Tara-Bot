This is mostly just for a joke and not really somehting to be taken all that seriously but heres how this shit works.

the bot will need to be registered with Discord at https://discord.com/developers

Once thats done you need to find a way to host the bot so that is is running, then invite the bot to the server. If dont correctly the bot will quietly leave silly comments
